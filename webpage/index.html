        <h2.a>What is DOM ?</h2>

        DOM stands for Document Object Model. In simple terms, it is a structured representation of the HTML elements that are present in a webpage or web app. DOM represents the entire UI of your application. The DOM is represented as a tree data structure. It contains a node for each UI element present in the web document. It is very useful as it allows web developers to modify content through JavaScript, also it being in structured format helps a lot as we can choose specific targets and all the code becomes much easier to work with.
        Disadvantages of real DOM :

        Every time the DOM gets updated, the updated element and its children have to be rendered again to update the UI of our page. For this, each time there is a component update, the DOM needs to be updated and the UI components have to be re-rendered.
        Example: 

        // Simple getElementById() method
        document.getElementById('some-id').innerValue = 'updated value';

        Recalculating the CSS and changing the layouts involves complex algorithms, and they do affect the performance. So React has a different approach to dealing with this, as it makes use of something known as Virtual DOM.
        Virtual DOM

        React uses Virtual DOM exists which is like a lightweight copy of the actual DOM(a virtual representation of the DOM). So for every object that exists in the original DOM, there is an object for that in React Virtual DOM. It is exactly the same, but it does not have the power to directly change the layout of the document. 

        Manipulating DOM is slow, but manipulating Virtual DOM is fast as nothing gets drawn on the screen. So each time there is a change in the state of our application, the virtual DOM gets updated first instead of the real DOM.
